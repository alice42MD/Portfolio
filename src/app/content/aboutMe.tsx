        Curious and versatile, I love exploring, learning, and bringing ideas to
        life, whether through code, art, or creation in all its forms.

        As a front-end developer, my journey is a bit unconventional: after
        running a bar and working in film set design, I dove into coding by
        joining 42.

      <span>
        I specialize in TypeScript and React to create dynamic and intuitive
        interfaces.

        Very interested in design, I love imagining user experiences that are
        harmonious and aesthetic, where ergonomics meet creativity.
      </span>{" "}
      <br />
      <span>
        I enjoy learning, experimenting, and finding elegant solutions to
        technical challenges.

      <br />
      <span>
        Creativity is my driving force, whether through drawing, cooking,
        crafting unusual objects, or even crochet. I love exploring,
        repurposing, assembling, and bringing original ideas to life, whether on
        a screen or in the real world, drawing inspiration from my travels,
        cinema, and music.

      <span>
        When I'm not coding or crafting, I enjoy the company of my cat, Chirac,
        who has as much charisma as his namesake.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        If we share interests or have a fun project to brainstorm together, I'm
        always up for a chat!
